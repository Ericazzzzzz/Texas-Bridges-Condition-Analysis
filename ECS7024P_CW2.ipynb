    "### 1.1 The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data comes from the [National Bridge Inspection](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/nbi/ascii.cfm) section of the FHWA's web site. However, this dataset has been greatly simplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The aim of the Bridge Inspection programme is to check on the state of bridges so that necessary repairs can be carried out. If this is not done, a bridge can fail. The dataset has information about the bridges and the condition given in the most recent inspection.**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The FHWA's database covers the whole USA, but this dataset focuses exclusively on Texas. \n",
    "* While the FHWA dataset also includes tunnels and culverts, the Texas data used here includes only bridges. Culverts (drains under highways) have been removed..\n",
    "* All of the bridges carry a highway, but what lies underneath (another road, waterway, or railway) varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The original FHWA dataset has over 100 variables (Texas collects even more). This version have been simplifies to include both continuous and categorical variables. \n",

    "### 1.2 Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "The Texas Department of Transportation aims to investigate how well specific variables can predict the current condition of bridges. The following variables are of interest: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Age** (derived from the `Year` variable)\n",
    "2. **Average Daily Traffic** (`AverageDaily`)\n",
    "3. **Percentage of Trucks** (`Trucks_percent`)\n",
    "4. **Material** (`Material`)\n",
    "5. **Design** (`Design`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The current condition of bridges is derived from three variables `Deck_rating`, `Superstr_rating` and `Substr_rating` of the bridges. \n",
    "The department wishes to answer following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How well can these variables predict the current condition of bridges?\n",
    "2. Which variables have the greatest influence on the current condition?\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of regression has been agreed in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Loading the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "A 'type map' is used to set the appropriate data types for each variable. Non-numeric fields are represented as categorical variables: using type `category` gives the default behaviour (use each unique value as a category and categories are not ordered). However, for the ordinal variables (such as Ratings) must be declared with a suitable type explicitly.   \n",
